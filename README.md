# 30 Days Map Challenge 2021 (Pokemon Edition)
Each map will use a different color palette from the [Pokemon Color Palettes](https://plugins.qgis.org/styles/103/) for QGIS available in QGIS HUB.  
All maps, unless stated otherwise, are made using only QGIS.

## Map 1 - Points

A map showing the centroids (and polygons, I'm not a monster) of all the countries that do not contain their centroids,   
meaning the center of the country is outside of its borders.   
The maps background and features are styled using the **Abra** color palette.

## Map 2 - Lines

Maps 2 and 3 belong to the same project, except for the roads layer in map 2 and the buildings layer in map 3 they are the same.  
The switch in symbology is done using map themes and an expression that check if a specific layer is visible.  
Map showing the roads in San Francisco, California, United States, Clipped to the shape of the pokemon **Nidorina** hiding in tall grass.  
Clipping was done with a traced polygon in the map layout, and background created with a random marker fill over a white simple fill.   
The maps background and features are styled using the **Nidorina** color palette.

## Map 3 - Polygons

## Map 4 - Hexagons

Map showing South Americe split into hexagons 50km high and wide anc colored by population estimate,   
without a legend because the colors have exactly 0 meaning and the ramp is not graduated.    
The grid was created in QGIS and then connected to a Natural Earth countries layer through a spatial join.  
The maps background and features are styled using the **Pikachu** color palette.

## Map 6 - Red

Days 6,7,8 all show the same data, but in different color palettes,  
For this I took a similiar approach to how my wife makes these maps,  
but in pokemon colors, if you're looking for a good looking map of London,   
you can check out [her etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/il-en/listing/1101325891/london-city-map-choose-your-color)

<img src="10-Raster(Gastly).png" alt="10-Raster(Gastly)" width="60%"/>

## Map 11 - 3D

Map showing extruded buildings and roads in Tel Aviv - Yafo, Israel.   
extrusion is by z factor for roads, for buildings extrusion is by height when available, number of levels (times 4 meters),  
or 8 meters when neither height or levels is available.

<img src="11-3D(Porygon).png" alt="11-3D(Porygon).png" width="60%"/>

## Map 12 - Population

Map showing population change in Great Britain urban centers,  
Data is from the European Commission's Global Human Settlement Layer, Urban Centre Database 2015,  
displayed over the land layer from Open Zoomstack which is  OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2021   
No idea why Open Zoomstack doesn't iclude North Ireland.
The maps background and features are styled using the **Victreebel** color palette. 

<img src="12-Population(Victreebel).png" alt="12-Population(Victreebel)" width="60%"/>

## Map 13 - Data challenge 2: Natural Earth

Map displaying some of the Natural Earth available layers,  
layers shown are: Land, Bathymetry, Parks & Protected Areas, Urban Areas, RIver, Lakes, Airports and Sea Ports.  
Data is obviously from Natural Earth.
Since I used so many layers had to use more than one palette for this, so background and features are styled using the **Nidoqueen** and **Nidoking** color palettes.  

<img src="13-Natural Earth(Nidoqueen&Nidoking).png" alt="13-Natural Earth(Nidoqueen&Nidoking)" width="60%"/>

## Map 14 - Map with a new tool

Used <a href="https://studio.unfolded.ai">Unfolded Studio</a> to create this map,  
Just started it out and used a shared dataset which was called San Francisco elevation and seems to be divided into H# placekey hexagons.  
Changed the color scale to use **Venusaur** colors.  

<img src="14-New Tool(Venusaur).gif" alt="14-New Tool(Venusaur)" width="60%"/>

## Map 15 - Map made without using a computer

For this one I just screenshot the Kanto region map fro Pokemon Leaf Green from an emulator on my phone.  
Used QGIS to add stripes over it to get a filter with **Golbat** Color Palette.  

<img src="15-No Computer(Golbat).png" alt="15-No Computer(Golbat)" width="60%"/>
  
My Wife said using the phone was cheating so I also made a second map, which is my neighborhood, colored by (pretty much) the **Golbat** colors.  

<img src="15-No Computer2(Golbat).png" alt="15-No Computer2(Golbat)" width="60%"/>

## Map 16 - Urban/rural

Map showing the urban areas of Italy according to Natural Earth.  
Used an expression to filter out polygons outside of Italy in the symbology 
```py
    if(
        intersects( 
            transform( $geometry,'EPSG:4326',@project_crs ) ,
            geometry(
                get_feature( 'ne_countries','name','Italy')
                )
            ),
         "scalerank" ,99)
```  
The maps background and features are styled using the **Scyther** color palette.
